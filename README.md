# Music-Genre-Classification-using-PyTorch
This project focuses on classifying 3-second audio clips into music genres using a fully connected neural network built with PyTorch. The dataset used is derived from the GTZAN dataset, and includes pre-extracted audio features stored in features_3_sec.csv.
Total of 10 genres, with numerical features already extracted (no raw audio processing required).
